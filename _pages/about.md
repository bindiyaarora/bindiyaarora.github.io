I completed my PhD. degree from the University of Delaware in the year 2008 with Dr. M. S. Safronova. During my Phd. I have worked on the modeling of atomic systems for atomic clocks and quantum computation. A copy of the thesis can be found here. After completion of my PhD. I worked at the Indian Institute of Science education and research (IISER), Mohali, India as a Scientist (Nov. 2010- Oct. 2011). Thereafter I joined the Department of Physics, Guru Nanank Dev University as Assistant Prof. (Oct. 2011-Present). I was awarded Young Scientist Award by the Punjab Science Congress in 2012 for my outstanding work in the field of Blackbody radiation shift calculations for optical clocks. I was selected for the DFG-INSA exchange of scientists program to visit University of Kaiserslautern, Germany in 2018.  I have also been awarded a three year funding from the Government of India to work on a project based on Quantum Information and Rydberg atoms. I have also worked in collaboration with National Physical Lab, New Delhi on the development of atomic and optical clocks which serve as Indiaâ€™s primary time ad frequency standard. At present, I am actively involved in teaching and researching in my department.


*Some of the new projects I am involved in are:*
=====
1. Atomic and optical frequency standards
1. Quantum computations using ions and atoms
1. High precision atomic property calculations
1. Quantum collapses and revivals of wave packets
1. Theoretical study of nano-structure  for their application in Photovolatics and sensors
1. Use of OpenMx and VASP for material science
